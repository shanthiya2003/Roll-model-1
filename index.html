Mukherjee Street in calcutta the capital of British india,on 12 January 1863 during the Makar Sankranti festival. He belonged to a traditional
family and was one of nine siblings.His father,Vishwanath Datta,was an attotney at the Calcutta High Court Duracharan Datta,Narendra's granfather was a Sanskrit and Persian scholar who left his family and became a monk at age twenty-five.His mothe,Bhubaneswari DEVI,was a deviut housewife.the progressive.rational attitude of Narendra's father and the religious temperament of his mother helped shape his thinking and personality.Narendranath wascinterested in soirtiuality from a young age and used to mrditate before the image of deitiesn such as shiva,RAMA sita,and Mahavir Hanuman.He was fascinated by wandering ascetics 
and monks.Nerendea was mischievous and mothr said,"Ipray to shiva for a son and he sent me one of his demons".</p>

<h1>Education</h1>
In 1871, at the age of eight, Narendranath enrolled at Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar's Metropolitan Institution, where he went to school until his family moved
 to Raipur in 1877. In 1879, after his family's return to Calcutta, he was the only student to receive first-division marks in the Presidency College 
entrance examination. He was an avid reader in a wide range of subjects, including philosophy, religion, history, social science, art and literature.
 In 1881, he passed the Fine Arts examination, and completed a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1884. Narendra studied the works of Davi
Hume, Immanuel Kant, Johann Gottlieb Fichte, Baruch Spinoza, Georg W. F. Hegel, Arthur Schopenhauer, Auguste Comte, John Stuart Mill and
 Charles Darwin.He became fascinated with the evolutionism of Herbert Spencer and corresponded with him,translating Herbert 
Spencer's book Education (1861) into Bengali. While studying Western philosophers, he also learned Sanskrit scriptures and Bengali literature.

<h1>Meeting Ramakrishna</h1>

In 1881, Narendra first met Ramakrishna, who became his spiritual focus after his own father had died in 1884.
Narendra's first introduction to Ramakrishna occurred in a literature class at General Assembly's Institution when he heard Professor William Hastie
 lecturing on William Wordsworth's poem, The Excursion.While explaining the word "trance" in the poem, Hastie suggested that his students visit
 Ramakrishna of Dakshineswar to understand the true meaning of trance. This prompted some of his students (including Narendra) to visit Ramakrishna.
sThey probably first met personally in November 1881, though Narendra did not consider this their first meeting, and neither man mentioned this meeting later.
 At this time, Narendra was preparing for his upcoming F. A. examination, when Ram Chandra Datta accompanied him to Surendra Nath Mitra's, house where
 Ramakrishna was invited to deliver a lecture.[66] According to Makarand Paranjape, at this meeting Ramakrishna asked young Narendra to sing. 
Impressed by his singing talent, he asked Narendra to come to Dakshineshwar.

<h1>Travels in India (1888–1893)</h1>
Main article: Swami Vivekananda's travels in India (1888–1893)
In 1888, Narendra left the monastery as a Parivrâjaka— the Hindu religious life of a wandering monk, "without fixed abode, without 
ties, independent and strangers wherever they go". During his travels he met, and stayed with Indians from all religions and walks of life: 
scholars, dewans, rajas, Hindus, Muslims, Christians, paraiyars (low-caste workers) and government officials.On 31 May 1893, Narendra left Bombay for 
Chicago with the name, assuggested by Ajit Singh of Khetri, "Vivekananda"–a conglomerate of the Sanskrit words: viveka and ānanda, meaning 
"the bliss of discerning wisdom".

<h1>Back in India (1897–1899)</h1>
The ship from Europe arrived in Colombo, British Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) on 15 January 1897, and Vivekananda received a warm welcome. 
In Colombo, he gave his first public speech in the East. From there on, his journey to Calcutta was triumphant. Vivekananda travelled from Colombo 
Sto Pamban, Rameswaram, Ramnad, Madurai, Kumbakonam and Madras, delivering lectures. Common people and rajas gave him an enthusiastic reception. 

<h1>Death</h1>
On 4 July 1902 (the day of his death), Vivekananda awoke early, went to the monastery at Belur Math and meditated for three hours. He taught Shukla-Yajur-Veda,
 Sanskrit grammar and the philosophy of yoga to pupils, later discussing with colleagues a planned Vedic college in the Ramakrishna Math. At 7:00 pm 
Vivekananda went to his room, asking not to be disturbed; he died at 9:20 p.m. while meditating.According to his disciples, Vivekananda attained
 mahasamādhi;the rupture of a blood vessel in his brain was reported as a possible cause of death. His disciples believed
 that the rupture was due to his brahmarandhra (an opening in the crown of his head) being pierced when he attained mahasamādhi. Vivekananda fulfilled his prophecy 
that he would not live forty years.He was cremated on a sandalwood funeral pyre on the bank of the Ganga in Belur, opposite where Ramakrishna was cremated sixteen years earlier.[173]
After a brief visit to the Advaita Ashrama in Mayavati, Vivekananda settled at Belur Math, where he continued co-ordinating the works of Ramakrishna Mission,
Religions in 1901 in Japan due to deteriorating health, he made pilgrimages to Bodhgaya and Varanasi.[164] Declining health (including asthma, diabetes and
 chronic insomnia) restricted his activity.
On 1 May 1897 in Calcutta, Vivekananda founded the Ramakrishna Mission for social service. Its ideals are based on Karma Yoga, and its governing body consists 
of the trustees of the Ramakrishna Math (which conducts religious work). Both Ramakrishna Math and Ramakrishna Mission have their headquarters at Belur 
Math. Vivekananda founded two other monasteries: one in Mayavati in the Himalayas (near Almora), the Advaita Ashrama and another in Madras (now Chennai).
 Two journals were founded: Prabuddha Bharata in English and Udbhodan in Bengali.That year, famine-relief work was begun by Swami Akhandananda
 in the Murshidabad district.
